## ToolChain
`Actual GCC BUT`
This uses my own gcc configurator wich reads inc.txt

Exemple inc.txt:
```
main main.c 
out test
./include i 
./lib l 
!-Wall -Wextra
```

and it genrates
`gcc -o test main.c -I./include -L./lib -Wall -Wextra`

the inc.txt file allready in the folder so to run the game

```bash
build #the programs on ~/bin wich builds program over inc.txt
./test
```

or 

```bash
gcc -o test main.c ./includes/errors.c ./includes/tetmin.c ./includes/player.c ./includes/kstring.c ./includes/command.c ./includes/map.c ./includes/utils.c ./includes/enemy.c -I./includess -Wall -Wextra
```
