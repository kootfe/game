# Game.c
`Thats not an actual game`
Hello im `Koofte`. This project is for me to lern things and actualy do them

## Chalages
While doing this project i put mysefl a chalange for fun. `Evrything must be in one file` wich is main.c.
The reason is i wana force myself to think harder.

## Why my code leaks Error Handleing and Memmory Managment
the main reason is i dont want spent time on these yet. i add so many functions and remove so many so frequently so i want add them later to save time

## ToolChain
`Actual GCC BUT`
This uses my own gcc configurator wich reads inc.txt

Exemple inc.txt:
```
main main.c 
out test
./include i 
./lib l 
!-Wall -Wextra
```

and it genrates
`gcc -o test main.c -I./include -L./lib -Wall -Wextra`

the inc.txt file allready in the folder so to run the game

```bash
build #the programs on ~/bin wich builds program over inc.txt
./test
```
